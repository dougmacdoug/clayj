TODO
===================

* collect todos from code
* mutli-module maven build (will /lib need to move?)
* demo module (might need 1 per demo especially if we make different renderers)
* instructions for jextract folder
* build instructions for lib/
* get raylib.dll/so and clay.dll/so into the correct folders
* maybe add maven build step to create dll/so.. this should be profiled
* current-scope-arena
* arena with no allocation but used for reinterpret
* java demo
* LWJGL renderer and demo https://www.lwjgl.org/guide
* graalvm native-image demo (this will require making 3 upcall functions in C)
* make sure the entire allocation stack is cleared each frame
* fix color
* make a raylib/clay converter (v2/color/other?) for renderer/demo that can use temp alloc
* javadoc on all functions
* fixup the #regions (add more) and reorganize Clay.java cleanly
* add some unit tests for the allocators/
